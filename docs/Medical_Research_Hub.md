# Medical Research Hub, Web3 Patient Portal

## Description

The Medical Research Hub, Web3 Patient Portal, is an innovative platform designed to empower patients by giving them ownership and control over their medical data. Utilizing the latest advancements in blockchain technology and Web3 paradigms, this project reimagines the healthcare experience, focusing on the patient’s journey from doctor visits to laboratory tests, and ultimately to medical research contributions.

### Key Features and Functionalities

1. **Simulation of Healthcare Processes:** Our platform replicates the experience of visiting a doctor, where tests are conducted and results are securely sent to the patient’s decentralized identity (DID) wallet.

2. **Verified Medical Data Sharing:** Patients can contribute their verified laboratory results to medical research through our Medical Research Hub. This process ensures data authenticity and patient consent.

3. **Decentralized Identities (DIDs):** We employ decentralized identities (DIDs) to ensure patient data ownership and privacy. This includes creating DIDs, credential schemas, verifying credentials, proof-requests, DIDComm, and presentations.

4. **Innovative Technologies:** The platform leverages selective disclosure and BBS+ algorithms to enhance security and privacy. These technologies allow patients to share specific data without exposing all their personal information.

5. **Incentivization for Contribution:** In appreciation of contributing to medical research, participants receive a monetary reward, fostering a mutually beneficial ecosystem.

### Technological Aspects

- Decentralized identities (DIDs) methods for secure and private data handling.
- DIDComm for secure communication between entities in the healthcare and research ecosystem.
- Advanced cryptographic techniques like BBS+ for data integrity and selective disclosure.

### Problem Addressed

Today’s healthcare systems lack a mechanism for patients to truly own and control their medical data. Our project addresses this gap by demonstrating how patients can take ownership of their medical data and contribute it securely, privately, and efficiently to medical research. The Web3 Patient Portal not only enhances patient autonomy but also accelerates medical research through ethical data sharing.

## Innovation and Unique Aspects

Our use of decentralized identities, selective disclosure, and cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms positions the Medical Research Hub as a pioneer in the intersection of blockchain technology and healthcare. By empowering patients and facilitating data sharing for research, we are setting new standards for privacy, security, and efficiency in medical data management.
